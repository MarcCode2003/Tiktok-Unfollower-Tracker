## Project Overview
TikTok Unfollower Tracker is a lightweight web-based tool designed to help users identify which of their TikTok followers have unfollowed them. This tool addresses a common gap in many social media platforms, where users are not notified when someone they follow decides to unfollow them. It’s particularly relevant for individuals who prioritize maintaining mutual follow relationships with friends, close acquaintances, or other connections.

## Purpose and Motivation
The motivation for creating this tool comes from a desire to promote fair social interactions and discourage practices that misrepresent one’s social presence. Some users tend to follow others solely to get a follow-back, only to later unfollow them quietly. This strategy can create an illusion of having a high follower count and a minimal following list, making their account appear more like a celebrity or influencer profile.

While this may seem trivial to some, it can be frustrating for users who value mutual connections and prefer a balanced social experience. The purpose of this project is not to encourage obsessive tracking or negative behavior, but rather to provide transparency and allow users to better manage their relationships on social media platforms.

## Why This Matters
In traditional social media dynamics like on Facebook, when one user unfriends another, the connection is severed from both ends, ensuring transparency. However, on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, and others, the following relationship is often one-sided. If one user unfollows, the other person is left unaware and may continue to engage with content under the assumption of a mutual connection.

This tool helps users understand these subtle shifts, encouraging a more ethical use of social media. For those who want to grow their following organically and avoid being misled by deceptive practices, having this kind of feature can be valuable. However, it's essential to use it responsibly and respect others choices to connect or disengage.

Additional Notes
- Enjoy the process of cleaning up your following list!
- I will continue to improve this tool in the future, so stay tuned for updates.
- I aim to expand support to other social media platforms, making this tracker more versatile.
- Since setting this up can be complex for those unfamiliar with programming tools like VSCode, I will focus on simplifying the process to make it more user-friendly.
- Lastly, I hope to build a universal tracker that works across popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), Threads, and more, so users can track and manage all their social media connections in one place.
